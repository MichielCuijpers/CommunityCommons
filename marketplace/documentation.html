<h2>Description</h2>

<p>This module adds many reusable java methods to your project, which can be called from microflows or custom java actions. The content of this module is the result of many questions and answers posted at mxforum.mendix.com, and investigating several project.</p>

<p>The module adds functionality for working with Dates, Batches, Strings, Internet, Files, Configuration etc. See the documentation or screenshot for a complete list of functions.</p>

<h2><em>Important when updating</em> ⚠️</h2>

<h3>Deprecated function removal</h3>

<p>The RegexTest function was already deprecated for some time because you can use the isMatch() function in microflow expressions instead. In version 8.0.1, we removed this function.</p>

<h3>Deleting obsolete dependencies first</h3>

<p>It is <em>highly</em> recommended that you remove all jars that have an accompanying .CommunityCommons.RequiredLib file from the userlib folder by hand before importing the CommunityCommons 7.2.0 (or higher) module in the Modeler. Otherwise you may encounter strange compilation or runtime errors.</p>

<h3>Java 8</h3>

<p>This release utilizes some Java 8 native APIs that replace functionality that was previously imported from external libraries. This means that for upgrading, <a href="http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jdk8-downloads-2133151.html" rel="nofollow">Java 8</a> is a minimum requirement! You can change your JDK directory in the Desktop Modeler under Edit &gt; Preferences. For Mendix 8, <a href="https://adoptopenjdk.net/?variant=openjdk11&amp;jvmVariant=hotspot" rel="nofollow">AdoptOpenJDK 11</a> will be supported.</p>

<h3>Breaking change to XSSSanitize</h3>

<p>In order to mitigate some security vulnerabilities in dependent libraries, in version 7.2.0 the XSSSanitize action has been re-implemented using the <a href="https://github.com/OWASP/java-html-sanitizer" rel="nofollow">OWASP Java HTML Sanitizer</a> library. This means that any usage of this action in your app needs to be reconfigured. It now takes six policy parameters, of which at least one must be non-empty. Make sure that the non applicable policy parameters are explicitly filled in with the value empty. Possible policy values are defined in the SanitizerPolicy enumeration. The meaning of the policies are defined in the <a href="https://static.javadoc.io/com.googlecode.owasp-java-html-sanitizer/owasp-java-html-sanitizer/20180219.1/org/owasp/html/Sanitizers.html" rel="nofollow">javadocs</a>.</p>

<h2>Usage</h2>

<p>All functions in this package can be invoked using a microflow Java action call in a Microflow, our from your own java code by calling</p>

<p>communitycommons..;</p>

<p>for example : commonitycommons.StringUtils.hash("Mendix", 20);</p>

<p>The module contains one constant: CommunityCommons.MergeMultiplePdfs_MaxAtOnce. It is used in the <em>MergeMultiplePdfs</em> Java action to restrict the number of PDFs processed at the same time. Restricted to 10 files at once for Mendix Cloud v4 compatibility. If you need to merge more than 10 files increase the number here. Setting the value to &lt;= 0 means unlimited.</p>

<h2>Testing</h2>

<p>The Community Commons container project contains a variety of predesigned unit tests. To be able to use these tests the UnitTesting module should be downloaded from the AppStore. Please refer to the UnitTesting documentation for further instruction regarding the implementation. The UnitTesting has a dependency to the ObjectHandling module, so that module should also be imported to this project if you want to run the tests.</p>

<h3>Gradle</h3>

<p>In version 7.2.0, we introduce a new way of dependency management using a <a href="https://gradle.org/install/" rel="nofollow">Gradle</a> build file. Unfortunately, this doesn't mean that obsoleted jars are automatically deleted from your projects' userlib folder when you import the Community Commons module into your app model.</p>

<p>To download the dependencies and copy them to the userlib/ folder of the Community Commons container project, execute:</p>
gradle prepareDeps

<p>from the command line. Afterwards, you will be able to export a CommunityCommons.mpk module from the Community Commons main project. Select only the dependencies listed below as dependencies in userlib for the exported module.</p>

<h2>Dependencies</h2>

<p>For security reasons, Guava was upgraded to version 27 in Community Commons v7.4.0. This unfortunately means a number of new required jars in the userlib folder.</p>

<ul><li>animal-sniffer-annotations-1.17.jar</li><li>checker-qual-2.5.2.jar</li><li>commons.io-2.6.jar</li><li>commons.lang3-3.7.jar</li><li>error-prone-annotations-2.2.0.jar</li><li>j2objc-annotations-1.1.jar</li><li>jsr305-3.0.2.jar</li><li>pdfbox-2.0.13.jar</li><li>fontbox-2.0.13.jar</li><li>guava-27.0-jre.jar</li><li>owasp-java-html-sanitizer-20181114.1.jar</li></ul>

<p><em>TimeMeasureEnd</em> - End timing something, print the result to the log, and return the time taken in milliseconds.</p>

<h3>Misc</h3>

<p><em>AssertTrue</em> - Shorthand for checking something, and throwing an error if that something is not true. Saves creating three microflow items for things that MUST be true.</p>

<p><em>CreateUserIfNotExists</em> - (Microflow) Create a user with predefined password an role. Useful during startup for integration purposes. Changed in 2.4: The user now always gets updated, if even the user already exists.</p>

<p><em>Delay</em> - Causes this request to sleep for a number of milliseconds. Useful to prevent brute force attacks or to simulate latency delays.</p>

<p><em>GetCFInstanceIndex</em> - Returns the Cloud Foundry Instance Index that is set during deployment of the application in a Cloud native environment. Returns 0 for the leader instance, 1 or higher for slave instances or -1 when the environment variable could not be read (when running locally or on premises).</p>

<p><em>RunMicroflowAsyncInQueue</em> - Runs a microflow asynchronous, that is, this action immediately returns but schedules the microflow to be run in the near future. The queue guarantees a first come first serve order of the microflows, and only one action is served at a time. The microflow is run with system rights in its own transaction, and is very useful to run heavy microflows on the background.</p>

<p><em>executeMicroflowInBackground</em> - Similar to RunMicroflowAsyncInQueue, but accepts one argument as parameter.</p>

<p><em>executeMicroflowInBatches (Recommended!)</em> - Performs a batch operation on a large dataset, by invoking the microflow on small subsets of the data, each with its own database transaction.</p>

<p><em>RegexReplaceAll</em> - Performs a regular expression replace. Works similarly to the microflow expression function 'replaceAll' but supports more constructs.</p>

<p><em>RegexQuote</em> - Escapes a string value so that it can be used literally with Mendix built-in regex replacement functions. (Otherwise the dollar sign would be interpreted as back reference to a match for example).</p>

<p><em>RemoveEnd</em> - Removes a string from the end of another string, if present</p>
